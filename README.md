## Project Goals

* Eventually integrate city/neighborhood rinks.
* Include rink lat/long.
* Include capabilities/function (e.g. outdoor, indoor, seasonality, etc.)
* Include links (e.g. event calendar, website, rink manager, etc.)
* Include routing information (address and/or current location via car).
* Filter by type/use.
* Include links to high school/youth hockey as well
